# p5-comfy-workshop

Workshop combining p5.js and ComfyUI, via RunComfy.com

---

## Overview

This is a workshop for combining p5.js and ComfyUI, deployed using cloud-based GPU servers at RunComfy.com. In this workshop, the canvas produced by simple generative code in p5.js is used to guide an img2img algorithm — effectively treating Stable Diffusion as a filter or renderer. The workshop is based on the [p5.comfyui-helper](https://github.com/gohai/p5.comfyui-helper) by [Gottfried Haider](https://github.com/gohai), the [comfyui-p5js-node](https://github.com/tracerstar/comfyui-p5js-node) by Benjamin Fox, and invaluable help from CMU BCSA student, [Lorie Chen](https://github.com/ylchen333/p5.comfyui-helper/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file). For related work, see also my [p5-in-comfyui](https://github.com/golanlevin/p5-in-comfyui), [image analysis](https://github.com/golanlevin/60-212/tree/main/lectures/comfy/image_analysis), and [image synthesis](https://github.com/golanlevin/60-212/tree/main/lectures/comfy/image_synthesis) lessons. This workshop was initially prepared for a presentation to undergraduates in RISD's Computation, Technology, and Culture (CTC) program in October, 2025.
